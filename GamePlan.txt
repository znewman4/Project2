Got it ✅ — instead of splitting roles, I’ll write the roadmap like a story: how the project grows step by step, each stage feeding into the next. That way, you can see how the regime classifier and the RL trading agent start as independent experiments, then gradually merge into a single intelligent trading system.

Story: Building a Regime-Aware RL Trader

⸻

Weeks 1–2: Laying the Groundwork

You begin with the essentials: data and environment.
	•	You collect historical price data (say BTC or SPY), clean it, and resample into consistent intervals (like 1h candles).
	•	Alongside, you code a simple trading environment — just like OpenAI Gym:
	•	Observations: last N prices and indicators.
	•	Actions: buy, sell, hold.
	•	Reward: change in portfolio value.

At this point, nothing is smart yet. To test that everything works, you run a random agent and a buy-and-hold agent, plotting equity curves. They’re dumb baselines, but they confirm your setup is correct.

⸻

Weeks 3–4: First Attempts at Intelligence

Now you start building two separate things in parallel:
	•	On one side, you make a market regime classifier. At first, it’s unsupervised: you take features like rolling volatility and momentum, run k-means clustering, and color the price chart based on the clusters. Suddenly, the market looks segmented — some periods are “calm,” others “choppy,” others “trending.”
	•	On the other side, you create your first RL agent. At first, it’s just tabular Q-learning on a synthetic toy market (say a random walk with drift). It learns crude behavior like “buy when prices rise.” You then upgrade it to a simple DQN with a neural net, and train it on BTC/USD. It doesn’t crush the market, but it shows signs of reacting to patterns.

You now have two building blocks: one that labels the market, and one that learns to trade. They’re still separate — but you can already see how they might talk to each other.

Weeks 5–6: Making the Pieces Smarter

Both sides level up.
	•	The regime classifier gets more sophisticated: you implement a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) so regimes aren’t just clusters, but actual latent states with probabilities and transitions. The plots now look more intuitive: the model knows that “high-vol trend” often transitions to “crash,” and “calm” often transitions to “slow bull.”
	•	The RL agent also improves. You enhance your DQN with experience replay and target networks, making it more stable. You also redesign the reward: not just raw PnL, but risk-adjusted (Sharpe ratio proxy, drawdown penalties). Suddenly, the agent’s equity curve is less wild — it starts acting more like a cautious trader.

At this point, each system works well enough alone to be useful. But the fun starts when you connect them.

⸻

Weeks 7–8: First Integration

Now comes the big step: regime-aware RL trading.
	•	First, you try the simple idea: separate RL agents for each regime. You train one agent only on “trending” regimes, another only on “mean-reverting,” and another only on “choppy.” Then, at runtime, your classifier decides which agent to use. The result: each agent becomes a specialist, and switching between them creates a “meta-strategy.”
	•	Next, you test a more elegant approach: a single RL agent that takes the regime label as an input feature. Instead of training specialists, you’re training a generalist that adapts depending on the market state. You compare performance between the “specialists” vs “generalist” approaches.

Suddenly, the whole system feels alive: the classifier interprets the world, and the agent acts in it.

⸻

Weeks 9–10: Testing the System

With the first integrated version working, you shift to stress-testing and benchmarking.
	•	You backtest on different markets (BTC, SPY, crude oil). Do regimes transfer across assets? Does the agent trained on BTC behave sensibly on SPY?
	•	You replay extreme events (COVID crash, flash crashes) and watch how the regime classifier detects the shift — and whether the RL agent adapts quickly enough.
	•	You benchmark against baselines: buy-and-hold, SMA crossovers, vanilla RL without regimes.

Here, the magic becomes clear: the regime-aware RL trader has smoother equity curves, lower drawdowns, and adapts better to shocks. It doesn’t just chase profits — it learns when to back off.

⸻

Weeks 11–12: Refinement & Polish

Now you polish the project into something presentable — and expandable.
	•	You visualize regime transitions alongside trades (e.g., green background = trending regime, red background = volatile regime, with the agent’s actions overlaid).
	•	You run multiple seeds and show statistical robustness (Sharpe, max DD, win rate distributions).
	•	You clean up the code so the classifier, RL agent, and integration can all be swapped in/out like modules.

By the end, you don’t just have a toy model — you’ve built a research-grade experiment:
	•	A market regime detection module.
	•	An RL agent that trades adaptively.
	•	A combined system that’s more robust than either alone.

⸻

The Big Picture
	•	At first, the project looks like two unrelated paths: one clustering prices, one trading in a toy world.
	•	Slowly, both paths mature in parallel, becoming sharper and more realistic.
	•	Then, at the midpoint, they merge — the classifier becomes the “eyes” of the system, and the RL agent becomes the “hands.”
	•	By the end, you have a meta-trader: a strategy that sees the market in context and acts with foresight.
